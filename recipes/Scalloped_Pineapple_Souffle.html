    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Scalloped pineapple is on the sweet spectrum, typically comprising a pineapple chunk mixture or in this case,
        crushed pineapple, adorned with bread cubes, sugar and butter. The result is a tender, sweeter pineapple dish.
        On the other hand, pineapple casserole, a Southern American specialty, like Paula Deen’s “southern pineapple
        casserole,” has cheddar cheese and flour in it. It has more of a sweet and savory profile. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 eggs, whites and yolks separated</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups white sugar</li>
        <li>½ cup butter</li>
        <li>½ cup milk</li>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) can crushed pineapple, drained</li>
        <li>3 cups cubed bread</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Step 1</b>
            <p>Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

            </p>
        </li>
        <li><b>Step 2</b>
            <p>Beat egg whites until foamy in a large glass or metal mixing bowl until stiff peaks form. Lift your
                beater or whisk straight up: the egg whites should form a sharp peak that holds its shape.</p>
        </li>
        <li><b>Step 3</b>
            <p>Beat the egg yolks, sugar, butter, and milk together in a large bowl. Stir in the pineapple and bread.
                Lightly fold egg whites into the pineapple mixture, then spread the mixture into a large baking dish
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><b>Step 4</b>
            <p>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 35 to 45 minutes.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
